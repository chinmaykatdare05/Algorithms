def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    """
    Performs Depth-First Search (DFS) on a graph starting from a given node.

    Time Complexity: O(V + E)
        - V: Number of vertices
        - E: Number of edges

    Space Complexity: O(V)
        - Due to the recursion stack (in the worst case, for a linear graph)

    Args:
        graph (dict): Adjacency list representing the graph.
        start (str/int): The starting node for DFS traversal.
        visited (set): A set to track visited nodes (default is None).

    Returns:
        list: The nodes visited in DFS order.
