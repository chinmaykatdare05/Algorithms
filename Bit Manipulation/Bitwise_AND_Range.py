def range_bitwise_and(left, right):
    """
    Performs bitwise AND on all integers between left and right (inclusive).

    Args:
        left (int): The start of the range.
        right (int): The end of the range.

    Returns:
        int: Result of bitwise AND from left to right.

    Time Complexity: O(log(right))
    Space Complexity: O(1)
