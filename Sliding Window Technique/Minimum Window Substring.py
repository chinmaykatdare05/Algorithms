    Finds the minimum window substring in 's' that contains all characters of 't'.

    Args:
        s (str): The input string to search within.
        t (str): The target string containing the required characters.

    Returns:
        str: The smallest substring that contains all characters of 't', or "" if no such substring exists.

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(m), where n is the length of 's' and m is the length of 't' (for the frequency count).
