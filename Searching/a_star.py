def astar(graph, start, goal, heuristic):
    """
    Performs the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path.

    A* uses both actual cost (g) and estimated cost (h) to find the optimal path.

    Time Complexity:
        - O(E log V) (Similar to Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm but depends on heuristic efficiency).

    Space Complexity:
        - O(V) (Stores all nodes in priority queue and path dictionary).

    Parameters:
        graph (dict): Adjacency list where keys are nodes, values are lists of (neighbor, cost).
        start (str/int): The starting node.
        goal (str/int): The goal node.
        heuristic (dict): Estimated heuristic costs from each node to the goal.

    Returns:
        list: The shortest path from start to goal.
