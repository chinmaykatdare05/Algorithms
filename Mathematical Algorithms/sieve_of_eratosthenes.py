    Generates all prime numbers up to 'n' using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

    Time Complexity: O(n log(log n))
    - The inner loop skips multiples in an optimized way, leading to this near-linear performance.

    Space Complexity: O(n)
    - We maintain a boolean array of size 'n+1' to track prime numbers.
