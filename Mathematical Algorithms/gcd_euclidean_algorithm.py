    Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean Algorithm.

    Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))

    Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Only a few variables are used.

print("GCD of 48 and 18:", gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6
print("GCD of 101 and 103:", gcd(101, 103))  # Output: 1 (they are co-prime)
